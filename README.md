# Document Verification System

## 📌 Overview
The **Document Verification System** is a web-based application that verifies uploaded documents by extracting text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and validating the extracted data against predefined rules or reference data.

This system helps reduce **manual verification effort**, **human errors**, and **fraud**, making it useful for institutions, organizations, and hackathon demonstrations.
